My portfolio website developed with Next.js 13, is live on https://sinabyr.ir .

I publish my projects to my website, and create a dedicated webpage for each of them explaining what the project is about, what it does, what its tech stack is, and what challenges I've faced developing the entire application. Basically, I describe why I made some desicions and how I came up with a solution fixing an issue or why I chose a way over others to implement a feature.

I also want to have a simple blog on my website, posting articles about what I learn myself. The idea of creating blog articles is coming from the fact that I really like teaching stuff to people and simplifying concepts that I struggled myself learning and understanding. Another way is to use ready Content Management Systems (CMS) like Medium and Ghost, the two of which I'll look into them in the future.
